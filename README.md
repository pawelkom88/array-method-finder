## About The Project

We all strugle to remember all array methods. There are so many of them. To make our life easier I
decided to create this tool. It is heavily inspired by one of the Sarah Drasner's project

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to practice React, Firebase and Git workflow.

## Why I built the project this way

- State management library like Redux or `useReducer` was not necessary. For this app simple
  `useState` is sufficent.

- I wanted to take advantage of React composition model and avoid props drilling or using context
  API.

- CSS modules are great for styling. They scoped locally by default. To make styling easier I used
  css variables.

- I used Firebase as backend for storing data.

## What I would change / upgrade if I have more time ?

- Add testing using Jest.
- Add animation.

Any suggestions to imporove the project are more than welcome.
